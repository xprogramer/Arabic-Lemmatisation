# Arabic stemmers
This repository regroups different Arabic stemmers that can be used in NLP and Information Retrieval tasks

The ARLSTem is a light Arabic stemmer that is based on removing the affixes from the word (i.e. prefixes,
suffixes and infixes). It was evaluated and compared to several other stemmers using Paice's parameters 
(under-stemming index, over-stemming index and stemming weight), and the results showed that ARLSTem is
promising and producing high performances. This stemmer is not based on any dictionary and can be used 
on-line effectively.
