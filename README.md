# Arabic stemmers
This repository regroups different Arabic stemmers that can be used in NLP and Information Retrieval tasks

The ARLSTem and ARLSTem2 are light Arabic stemmers that are based on removing the affixes from the word (i.e. prefixes,
suffixes and infixes). They were evaluated and compared to several other stemmers using Paice's parameters 
(under-stemming index, over-stemming index and stemming weight), and the results showed the two algorithms are
promising and producing high performances. These stemmers do not use any dictionary and can be used 
on-line effectively.
